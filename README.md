Create a BERT Model that processes Shaspearian text (one dialogue at a time)
and learns to reproduce it, by adding noise in between. The idea is to have
it trained to Generate text as accurately as possible.

# WHY?
I was asked by an Interviewer to do that, as part of an interview test.
This is by far the most interesting interview test I've had since Huawei's Reinforcement Learning with Attention Layer.
It allowed me to understand both the design and the code behind BERT.
